This package will try to replicate Vim's original\nNERD Tree functionality\n\n## Current functionality\n* Most of the key VIM NERD Tree default key bindings are working\n* Completely replaces standard Tree View bindings\n* Smooth scroll (NERD Tree like scroll - still unstable)\n\n## Planned/Not Available functionality\n* Search\n* Bookmarks (Integrate with Core Bookmarks?)\n* NERD Tree menu (Subtree management)\n* cd/CD (through ex-mode extention)\n* Try to use vim-mode functionality where/if possible\n* Expose API through service\n* Search highlight\n* Show line numbers on demand (both relative and absolute)\n\n## Installation Notes\n* **This is first, and very unstable version**\n* Best to use in conjunction with [vim-mode](https://atom.io/packages/vim-mode)\nand [ex-mode](https://atom.io/packages/ex-mode)\n* Better to disable default Tree View bindings in Tree View package settings\n\n## Tips\n#### Use ZZ to save-and-close current tab/split\nSee [vim-mode-zz](https://atom.io/packages/vim-mode-zz)\n\n## Default key bindings and events\n\n### General\n\nKey | Event | Description\n--- | ----- | -----------\nC-\\, D-\\ (mac), C-k C-b, D-k D-b
