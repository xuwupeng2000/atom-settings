# Nerd TreeView

The Nerd TreeView package will transform the native atom Tree View to somewhat
similar to the famous NERD Tree Vim plugin - hence the name

Some of the NERD Tree's functionality is present in the native Tree View by
default, but it doesn't expose any interface so apart from CSS developers
can't really change much. This package will try to replicate Vim's original
NERD Tree functionality

## Current functionality
* Most of the key VIM NERD Tree default key bindings are working
* Completely replaces standard Tree View bindings
* Smooth scroll (NERD Tree like scroll - still unstable)

## Planned/Not Available functionality
* Search
* Bookmarks (Integrate with Core Bookmarks?)
* NERD Tree menu (Subtree management)
* cd/CD (through ex-mode extention)
* Try to use vim-mode functionality where/if possible
* Expose API through service
* Search highlight
* Show line numbers on demand (both relative and absolute)

## Installation Notes
* **This is first, and very unstable version**
* Best to use in conjunction with [vim-mode](https://atom.io/packages/vim-mode)
and [ex-mode](https://atom.io/packages/ex-mode)
* Better to disable default Tree View bindings in Tree View package settings

## Tips
#### Use ZZ to save-and-close current tab/split
See [vim-mode-zz](https://atom.io/packages/vim-mode-zz)
